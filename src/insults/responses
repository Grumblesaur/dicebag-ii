You really ate the bones, %s.
Yo, %s, would you kindly stop breaking things?
Don't waste my time, %s.
Fuck you, %s!
Sorry, %s, I'm not really feeling up to your bullshit today.
Hey %s! Read the documentation!
Keep your hands to yourself, %s!
Eyes on your own work there, %s!
Syntax error: go fuck yourself, %s.
java.lang.Exception: HAH! This is Python! You really screwed the pooch now, %s!
No, %s. Not gonna happen.
Well, %s, that was inconsiderate.
Could you behave for two seconds, %s?
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, %s?
Must you break everything you touch, %s?
Do you live in a cave, %s?
